"""
Shared logic for the Bank-Recon (Java) integration.

fetch_erp_payments() used to be exposed as an internal HTTP endpoint that
Java called (internal_api.ErpPaymentsListView) — now that Java is a fully
stateless compute service with no outbound calls of its own, Django gathers
this data itself and sends it to Java as part of the single ingest-and-match
request. Kept as a plain function (not a view) so StatementUploadView can
call it directly with no HTTP round-trip.
